# Ogre!
Ogre! is a JavaScript script where a Warrior fights an Ogre. It is based on 2e AD&amp;D rules. This was my first attempt at coding a project all on my own after completing Codecademy Spring 2020.

I've started working on this again after starting a full stack coding bootcamp. More updates to come....
